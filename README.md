# Learning DevOps
I will be using this git repo as a place to learn how to use DevOps tools such as Ansible, Puppet, Jenkins, etc.
## Ansible
### What is Ansible
Ansible is an **open source, command-line IT automation software application** written in Python³. It can **configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows** to support application deployment, system updates, and more³¹. Ansible’s main strengths are **simplicity and ease of use**³². It also has a strong focus on **security and reliability**, featuring a minimum of moving parts, usage of OpenSSH for transport, and a language that is designed around auditability by humans².
